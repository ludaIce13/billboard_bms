# Billboard Management System (BMS)

A modular full-stack system built for managing billboard licenses, tariffs, and invoicing.
Includes placeholder integration for REVMIS API.

## How to Use
1. Navigate to `backend/`
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set your environment variables.
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Run development server:

   npm run dev
   ```

The `/api/invoices/revmis` endpoint logs invoice payloads and simulates REVMIS posting.
